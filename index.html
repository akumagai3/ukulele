'Cause every little thing gonna be all right

Singin': "Don't worry about a thing

Rise up this mornin'

Smile with the risin' sun

Three little birds

Pitch by my doorstep

Singin' sweet songs

Of melodies pure and true

Sayin', "This is my message to you-ou-ou"

'Cause every little thing gonna be all right!"

			<p class="lyrics">
                 When the night has come
				
				<br/>
And the land is dark
				
				<br/>
And the moon is the only light we'll see
				
				<br/>
No, I won't be afraid
				
				<br/>
Oh, I won't be afraid
				
				<br/>
Just as long as you stand
				
				<br/>
Stand by me
				
				<br/>

So darlin', darlin'
				
				<br/>
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
				
				<br/>
Oh, stand, stand by me
				
				<br/>
Stand by me
				
				<br/>

If the sky that we look upon
				
				<br/>
Should tumble and fall
				
				<br/>
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
				
				<br/>
I won't cry, I won't cry
				
				<br/>
No, I won't shed a tear
				
				<br/>
Just as long as you stand
				
				<br/>
Stand by me
				
				<br/>

And darlin', darlin'
				
				<br/>
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
				
				<br/>
Oh, stand now, stand by me
				
				<br/>
Stand by me
				
				<br/>
Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me?
				
				<br/>
Oh, stand by me
				
				<br/>
Won't you stand now?
				
				<br/>
Oh, stand, stand by me

			<p class="lyrics">
                 All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go, I'm standing here outside your door
			
				<br/>
I hate to wake you up to say good-bye
		
				<br/>
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn, the taxi's waiting He's blowing his horn
	
				<br/>
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

				<br/>
So kiss me and smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
				<br/>
Hold me like you'll never let me go
				<br/>

'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again
				<br/>
Oh, babe, I hate to go
				<br/>

There's so many times I've let you down, so many times I've played around
				<br/>
I tell you now they don't mean a thing
				<br/>
Every place I go I'll think of you, every song I sing I'll sing for you
				<br/>
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring
				<br/>
So kiss me and smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
				<br/>
Hold me like you'll never let me go
				<br/>

'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again
				<br/>
Oh, babe, I hate to go
				<br/>

Now the time has come to leave you, one more time let me kiss you
				<br/>
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
				<br/>
Dream about the days to come when I won't have to leave alone
				<br/>
About the times I won't have to say
				<br/>
Kiss me and smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
				<br/>
Hold me like you'll never let me go
				<br/>

'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again
				<br/>
Oh, babe, I hate to go
				<br/>
I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again
				<br/>
Oh, babe, I hate to go
				<br/>
